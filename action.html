                <p class="lead">We need to create enough pressure on Congress to ensure the creation of an independent investigation - there are already calls for action from many Democrats, but not enough to overcome to current Republican majority. In order to get this done, we have to mobilize the voice of the American people and make sure Congress understands how important this is.</p>
                <p class="lead">Individual protests have given us space to express our grievances with the Administration’s policies and positions, but haven’t stopped our democracy from beginning to come apart. To be heard, we have to be visible and disruptive in ways that Congress can’t ignore - if the Department of Justice can’t or won’t establish this investigation, we need to make sure that Congress can and will.</p>
                <p class="lead">We are now gathering voices that are willing to go to Washington and begin an enduring continuous protest that will last until we see the appointment of a special counsel and the inception of a true independent investigation, free from Congressional and executive meddling.</p>

                <p class="lead">In the meantime, demand that your Senators block all judicial and Department of Justice nominations until an independent law enforcement investigator is appointed. Ask them directly in town halls or public events, visit their district offices, and make calls requesting that they hold these nominations.</p>
