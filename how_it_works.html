              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
              <p class="lead">The decision to appoint a special prosecutor rests with the attorney general (or in this case, deputy attorney general), or, historically, with the president. Separately, Congress could initiate the process to create a different independent counsel for investigations by passing a law, The law, passed in 1978, was reauthorized several times until its sunset in 1999 and was used more than a dozen times to initiate investigations. It was used most famously in the 1990s to appoint attorney Kenneth Starr to oversee investigations on President Bill Clinton.</p>

              <p class="lead">Such a law would have to be either signed by Trump or, in the event of a presidential veto, overridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress. There is precedent, however, for a president to sign an independent counsel law amid scrutiny. Clinton signed a reauthorization of the 1978 law in 1994 with a number of alleged scandals brewing.</p>

              <p class="lead">A special counsel would also be expected to interview a vast range of people with knowledge of or connection to the investigation. In the case of the Trump-Russia allegations, a special counsel would look into any and all classified or declassified documents that the FBI, CIA, and various police departments and investigation groups might have the incident.</p>

              <p class="lead">This would include human or digital intelligence, and the dossier delivered by British intelligence. Extensive interviews would be run with anyone close to the situation, including Trump's inner circle, and anyone who had access to digital or technical related information, said Banks. The special counsel themselves would ultimately determine which evidence to use.</p>

              <p class="lead">What happens next depends in part on who appoints a special counsel. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would decide whether the special counsel appointed under him had enough evidence to prosecute Trump or implicated officials.</p>

              <p class="lead">If Congress created an office for an independent or special counsel, it is likely that the counsel would refer results of the investigation to Congress, though that could change depending on the legislation passed. If Congress initiated an investigation through a commission or committee, it would fall to the attorney general to decide whether to prosecute based on the results provided.</p>
