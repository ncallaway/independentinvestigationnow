                <p>
                    All of the usual strategies of applying pressure to congress still apply (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/demand-independent-russia-investigation/">call your representative, attend their town halls, and make your voice heard to your representative</a>). However,
                    it's time to start the discussion around creating a long-term Occupy Capitol Hill movement to ensure our demands are felt daily by members of congress.

                <h3>What do you mean independent?</h3>
                <p class="lead">An independent investigation is an investigation lead by a non-partisan individual or group.</p>

                <p>It's vitally important that the American people trust the results of any investigation into the interference in our elections by a foreign
                    power. As such, any investigations need to be done thouroughly and conducted by a party that a broad section of the country trusts.</p>

                <h3>Don't we already have investigations?</h3>
                <p class="lead">There are currently three known investigations into the Trump campaign and ties to Russian interference in our election.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, none of these investigations are independent. The House and Senate investigations are run by the same party as the President. Until
                recently, the FBI investigation was reasonably independent. However, with the recent firing of the Director of the FBI, that investigation is also not independent.</p>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p class="lead">We need either the Deputy Attorney General or Congress to create the independent investigation.</p>

                <p>
                    The Deputy Attourney General has the power to appoint a Special Prosecutor at any time. Further, either chamber of congress can create a Bipartisan Select
                    Committee to carry out the investigation. Ultimately, these things won't happen unless we put enormous pressure on the individuals who make these decisions.</p>
